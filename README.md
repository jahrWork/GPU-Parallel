<h1><ins>GPU Parallel Processing Documentation - Research Project 22-23 & 23-24</ins></h1>

> [!NOTE]
> - 🗂️ This repository gathers the documentation and work carried out by me (Pedro Rodríguez Jiménez) during the 2022/23 academic year, as well as the continuation of the work by his colleagues during the 2023/24 academic year. This will be the start point for this new 2024/25 academic year.
> 
> - 🎯 Objective: To explore and optimize numerical calculation codes using GPU parallel processing, with a comparison against traditional CPU-based solutions. The project aimed to evaluate different strategies and techniques to enhance computational efficiency using GPUs over CPUs.

### <ins>Requirements</ins>

##### <ins>2023</ins>

- **Python**: Version 3.12.2 or newer, with `NumPy`, `CuPy`, and other related libraries.
- **Fortran**: With Intel MKL and OpenMP for parallel processing.
- **C**: Using BLIS/AOCL for optimized linear algebra operations.
- **Matlab**: For comparison benchmarks.

##### <ins>2024</ins>

- **Julia**: Check Mario's branch documentation.


Specific instructions for setting up these environments can be found in their respective folders within this repository.

### <ins>Project Structure</ins>

- **`/Month_23`**: Contains my contributions from the 2022/23 academic year in chronological order.
- **`/Septiembre_24`**: Includes the work carried out by his colleagues in the 2023/24 academic year.

The second folder is still being compiled as some work by colleagues is not fully completed.

### <ins>Getting Started</ins>

Clone this repository by using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jahrWork/GPU-Parallel.git
```

<br>

### <ins>Final Results & Analysis</ins>
The project includes a comprehensive analysis of:

Execution times across different languages and platforms (Python, Fortran, C, Matlab).

Speed-up comparisons between single-core and multi-core CPU implementations.

GPU performance evaluations using the CuPy library.
