### <ins>Summary</ins>

This research project addresses four main topics within the field of parallel processing and numerical methods:

1. **CPU and GPU Performance Analysis**: This includes a comprehensive guide to using Julia and benchmark analysis of CPU and GPU performance to optimize numerical calculations.
2. **Global Interpolation and Finite Differences**: Advanced numerical methods such as Three-Point Finite Differences and Global Interpolation are explored to solve complex mathematical problems.
3. **Solving the Convective-Diffusive Heat Equation**: Utilization of numerical methods to solve differential equations describing heat transfer in fluids.
4. **Results and Final Analysis**: Evaluation of the outcomes from interpolation experiments and GPU/CPU simulations to assess computational efficiency.

The overall objective of the project is to identify the most effective strategies for improving computational efficiency in scientific and engineering applications, comparing traditional methods with advanced GPU parallelization techniques.
